# DESCRIPTION
################################################################################
# 
# This is a prototype 'test suite' datagram for mio's regression runner.
# Moore.io uses ip.yml, .mio.toml files as well as the contents here to figure
# out what (sub-)jobs to dispatch.
# 
# Note: each 'target' should be its own file. Only one set of compilation/
# elaboration parameters are allowed per suite.
